# Introduction

In modern applications, gathering user feedback through surveys is crucial for enhancing user experience and improving services. Embedding a bundled JavaScript code within your application enables seamless survey integration. However, there are instances where you might want these surveys to appear only under specific conditions.

This is where SurveySparrow's innovative feature, **SpotChecks**, comes into play
