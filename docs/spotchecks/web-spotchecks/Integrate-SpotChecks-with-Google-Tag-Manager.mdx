- Set the trigger for the snippet to “Initialization - All Pages”

### Identify the Visitors

The key functionality of SpotChecks is to identify the visitors and set survey triggers based on the user information. You can utilize this functionality by passing the necessary information to the following snippet through which you can set conditions.

In the userDetails, you are required to set the placeholders as you can find in the below image. The placeholders should match the variables created in the Google Tag Manager.

If the app holds only static data and there is no requirement to keep track of the users, you can pass the following snippet in a new tag.

```html
<script> window.SpotCheckLauncher('popup', { userDetails: {}, variables: {}, properties:{} });</script>
```
