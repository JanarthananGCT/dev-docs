### Overview

On the left panel of the SpotChecks settings page, you will find various fields essential for creating a target, customizing the appearance, and configuring the necessary settings for the specific target. On the right panel, you will find the preview of the target that you have customized.


### Target

A target represents a specific type of device and application on which the SpotChecks functionality will be integrated. For example:

- To embed a survey within your mobile application, create a target specifically for mobile.
- To embed a survey within your web application, create a separate target for the web application.

You have the flexibility to add as many targets as needed to suit your requirements.

To create a target, click on the Target dropdown, and select "**Add new target**". This will provide you with all instructions on how to embed SpotChecks on both mobile and web applications.


### Appearance

SpotChecks provides extensive customization options to align the survey with your application's UI theme. This includes styling, effects, and fonts, among other features, to enhance the user experience.

**Note:** In the mobile target, features namely **Sound Effects** and **Haptic Feedback** will be introduced in the future
