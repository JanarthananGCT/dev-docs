#### 2. [App Submission Process](#app-submission-process)

#### 3. [Custom apps](#custom-apps)

## Apps Overview:

The app development platform offers capabilities to build apps that can be broadly categorized as follows based on app users,

### App Types:

-   **Front-end apps:** Apps that run in response to events such as button clicks or page loads that happen on the product’s UI.

-   **Serverless apps:** Apps that run in response to events that occur in the product, or events that occur in an external product or service.

## App Submission Process:

To publish any app to our AppNest, you can submit the app under one of the following app types. App types determine how an app is available for consumption to app users - publicly displayed, private only to a SurveySparrow customer, listed in an external website, and so on.

-   **SurveySparrow App**: These apps extend the functionalities of SurveySparrow and are built using the SurveySparrow CLI. A SurveySparrow app is installed from the SurveySparrow AppNest.

-   **Custom App**:These apps address specific customer requirements and are available only to that customer. A custom app is not subjected to review it is available for installation as soon as it is submitted and published. The app submission process for Custom apps includes provisions to test multiple versions of an app in a production environment. After testing, you can choose to publish the most appropriate app version to app users.

## Custom Apps:

These apps address specific customer requirements and are available only to that customer. A custom app is not subjected to review it is available for installation as soon as it is submitted and published.

These apps are available for that particular account who published their app as a custom app in the AppNest. The apps listed in the Apps and Integration page once the app is published.

**How to publish a custom app:**

-   Go to AppNest First you will see all the apps which have been created by you. Then click New app to publish an app.

-   Upon clicking, give all the required details such as App Name, Short Description, App Overview, App Instructions, Video URL, Support Email, App Icon and App Package (can be obtained from running the command `ssdk pack`). You will also be prompted with other details such as Support URL and Website Link.

-   Once all those details are filled, the app will be published and is ready to use on your account. It is exclusively for your account since it is a custom app.

-   After this, if you want to update or delete the app you can click on that particular app’s tile and you can edit the necessary details. A new version of the app will be published upon changing the zip of the app.

-   At the end of the same page there will be an option for deleting the app, upon deleting all the versions and data related to the app will be deleted and the app will be removed from the apps and integrations tab in the settings page.

The custom app can be installed like a normal app. Only difference between a normal app and a custom app is a custom is only visible to the developer’s account who has published it.
