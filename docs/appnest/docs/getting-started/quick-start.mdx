#### **on Windows OS**:

- Installing Chocolatey package manager.
  - Launch Windows Powershell in Administrator mode.
  - Run the below command to install chocolatey.

    ```bash
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
    ```
  - If you face the issue - **running the scripts is disabled on the system**, run the following command ``` Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted ``` on the windows powershell or command prompt in administrator mode.

- Verify Chocolatey installation using the command given below.
Verify NVM installation

  ```bash
  choco -v
  ```

- Install NVM through the Chocolatey package manager.

  ```bash
  choco install nvm
  ```
- Install via installers

  - Download the NVM Setup from [here](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases/download/1.1.11/nvm-setup.exe) and Complete the installation process using the steps given [here](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#installation--upgrades).

#### **on Ubuntu**:

- If you don't have curl installed already, install it.

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install curl
  ```

- Run the NVM installation script as shown below

  ```bash
  curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
  ```

- The script clones the nvm repository to ~/.nvm, and attempts to add the source lines from the snippet below to the correct profile file (~/.bash_profile, ~/.zshrc, ~/.profile, or ~/.bashrc).

  ```bash
  export NVM_DIR="$([ -z "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}" ] && printf %s "${HOME}/.nvm" || printf %s "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm")"
  [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
  ```
- When faced with any issues, follow the instructions given [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) For more details, refer to

```
- To use Node.js 18

```bash
nvm use 18
```

- To verify that the node is installed correctly, run the following commands

```bash 
node â€“-version
```

### Install Mkcert
- Mkcert is a tool for making locally-trusted development certificates. This allows for installing SSL certificate, thereby running the local SSDK application securely.
- Mkcert does not have native support in Firefox. To proceed with your development work, you have the choice to either bypass security measures or manually integrate the certificate into your browser settings.

#### MacOS
```bash
brew install mkcert
```

#### Windows - Open command prompt or Windows powershell in administrator mode and run the below command.

```bash
choco install mkcert
```

## Install the sparrow CLI:

```bash
npm install https://ssdk.surveysparrow.dev/ssdk.tgz -g
```

- Run the following command to verify the CLI installation.

 ```bash
 ssdk version
 ```
 ![image-1](https://static.surveysparrow.com/application/marketplace/ssdk-assets/image1.png)
 
## Installation summary:
- Ensure that the versions of the corresponding packages are as suggested or higher.

```bash
#for nvm -v
0.38.0
# for node -v
v18.12.0
# for npm -v
9.5.1
# for ssdk version
0.1.1
```
## Develop an App:

&emsp; You can use the following steps to create an app that displays a sample text in the â€˜Apps & Integrationsâ€™ section of setting page.

- From the command line, navigate to the empty directory in which you want to create an app.

- Run the following command:
```bash
 ssdk create
```
- Select first_app. A new app is created based on the first_app template.

 ![image-1](https://static.surveysparrow.com/application/marketplace/ssdk-assets/image2.png)

 **The following directories and files are created as a result of the ssdk create command.**

| DIRECTORY/FILE | DESCRIPTION |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| app/*      | Contains all the files required for the front-end component of an app. The JS file follows the ES5 standard.|
| app/index.html     | Contains files to render front-end components of an app. This is the first page that is loaded when the app is activated. When building an app, if the app uses Data methods, Request method, Installation Parameters, or Data Storage, update the index.html file with the following reference to client.js: `<script src="https://ssdk.surveysparrow.dev/ssdk/2.0/assets/survey_client.js"></script>`     |
| app/scripts | Contains all the Javascript files required to support the front-end functionality of an app.  |
| app/scripts/app.js |  Contains the app logic to display. |
| app/styles|  Contains the styles required for the front-end components of an app. |
|app/styles/styles.css | Contains CSS rules that are incorporated to HTML files, when referenced.|
| app/styles/images | Contains images that can be used in the app. |
| app/styles/images/icon.svg | Contains the app icon. The icon file should be of SVG type with a resolution of 64 x 64 pixels. |
| config/* | Contains the installation parameters and oauth configuration files. |
| config/iparams.json* | Contains all the installation parameters whose values are set when the app is installed. For more information, see Installation Parameters. |
| manifest.json* | Contains details such as the platform version the app uses, product to which the app belongs, event listeners for serverless apps, SMI functions that can be invoked from the appâ€™s front end component.|
| README.md | Contains additional instructions, information, and code-related specifications pertaining to the app.|


**Note : When building an app, do not modify these file/folder names.**

If you want to add serverless functionality to your app, add the server.js file to the server folder from your appâ€™s root directory. Make sure you add appropriate configurations to the manifest.json file of your app
## Test a front-end app:

- From the command line, navigate to the directory that contains the app related files and run the following command.

```bash
ssdk run 
```
- If the ``` ssdk run ``` command causes an error regarding **mkcert -install**, then open up the text editor or the terminal in administrator mode and re-run the ``` ssdk run ``` command.

- Upon running ssdk run command you will be prompted to install a certificate on your browser for establishing HTTPS connection between your local app and your browser.

![image-5](https://static.surveysparrow.com/application/marketplace/ssdk-assets/image5.png)
- After you agree to install SSL certificate on your browser, the SSL certificate will be installed on your browser and the app will start running on HTTPS.

![image-6](https://static.surveysparrow.com/application/marketplace/ssdk-assets/image6.png)
- Log in to your <a href="https://app.surveysparrow.com">SurveySparrow account</a>

- To the SurveySparrow account URL, append `?dev=true`

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Example URL:
&emsp;`https://subdomain.surveysparrow.com/?dev=true`

- To allow the Chrome browser to connect to the test server that runs on HTTP,

 &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; - Navigate to Settings -> Advanced -> Privacy and security -> Site settings -> Insecure content.

 &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; - In the Allow section, click Add and enter the account URL.
Example URL:` https://subdomain.surveysparrow.com`

- To test and preview the app running in your local environment, 
  - Go to Settings -> select **apps & integrations**. You can see your app displayed in the app listing section. Ensure that **?dev=true** is appended to the url since the app is running in the local environment.

## Validate and Pack:

To check if the app is error-free and package it for submission, follow the given steps.

- To validate the code, run the following command.
```bash
ssdk validate [--app-dir DIR]
```
Here, DIR is the relative or absolute path to the project directory. If there are errors in the code, corresponding violations are displayed.

- To pack the app for submission, run the following command.
```bash
ssdk pack [--app-dir DIR]
```
The command generates the dist/my_first_app.zip file.

- To publish the app to the Sparrow AppNest, navigate to the [Sparrow developer portal](https://appnest.surveysparrow.com) and upload the packed file.

## Uninstall SSDK:
In case if you want to uninstall the ssdk do the following steps:

```bash
npm uninstall ssdk -g
```
```bash
rm -r ~/.ssdk
```
